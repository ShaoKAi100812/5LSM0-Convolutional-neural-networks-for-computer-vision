## Assignments of the course as title in Q3 at TU/e 
What I did are all shown in the `.ipynb` file in each assignment folder

### 1st assignment
Build up a multi-layer perceptron from scratch in python

### 2nd assignment
Build up a CNN model by Barebone Pytorch, Pytorch Module API, and Pytorch Sequential API.  
Besides, apply Image Retrieval with Neural Codes on CIFAR-10 dataset.

### 3rd assignment
Paper presentation - EfficientNet - Rethinking Model Scaling for Convolutional Neural Networks

### Final assignment
Take `Unet` as a baseline model for segmentation on Cityscape dataset and improve the accuracy by applying data augmentation, hyperparameters tuning, and architecture changing.
